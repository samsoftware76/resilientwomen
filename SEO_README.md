# 🚀 How to Rank Resilient Women CBO on Google

You now have a powerful SEO infrastructure (`sitemap.xml`, `robots.txt`, Schema Markup, and Keyword Pages). To make Google "see" this immediately, you must submit your sitemap to **Google Search Console**.

## ⚠️ Prerequisite: Deploy First
**You must merge the Pull Request and deploy the website first.**
Google cannot read the sitemap from your computer. It must be live at:
`https://www.resilientwomencbo.org/sitemap.xml`
